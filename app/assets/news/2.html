<p><div class="newsitemdescription"> Blow away the Christmas cobwebs and beat the winter blues by volunteering in the great outdoors for Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT)!  

 

Every Wednesday, throughout the year, SWT East area operates a conservation volunteer work party across its wildlife reserves, where participants carry out a range of practical tasks from scrub and small tree clearance to boardwalk installation, gate hanging and step building. 


SWT east area manager, Graham Manning, says: “Volunteering for the East Area Team of Surrey Wildlife Trust will make you part of our network of volunteering all over the county.  You’ll get free training and learn about our reserves and how your important work is benefitting the wildlife there, as well as the people who come to use and enjoy them.”


Tuition, tools and expert advice are given by SWT rangers and committed, long-term volunteers will be trained in brush cutter use and monitoring techniques, so they can expand their interests and be given specialist jobs to complete.


The volunteers meet at 9.15am at The Bothy in Norbury Park; transport is provided to and from site and work tasks finish around 3.30pm. Volunteers need to wear suitable outdoor clothing and bring a packed lunch (tea, coffee and biscuits are provided). 


If you’re interested in volunteering, please call Anna Fosbery on 01483 795464 or email anna.fosbery@surreywt.org.uk, for more information.
