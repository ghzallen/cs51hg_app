Every Wednesday, throughout the year, SWT East area operates a conservation volunteer work party across its wildlife reserves, where participants carry out a range of practical tasks from scrub and small tree clearance to boardwalk installation, gate hanging and step building. 


SWT east area manager, Graham Manning, says: “Volunteering for the East Area Team of Surrey Wildlife Trust will make you part of our network of volunteering all over the county.  You’ll get free training and learn about our reserves and how your important work is benefitting the wildlife there, as well as the people who come to use and enjoy them.”


Tuition, tools and expert advice are given by SWT rangers and committed, long-term volunteers will be trained in brush cutter use and monitoring techniques, so they can expand their interests and be given specialist jobs to complete.


The volunteers meet at 9.15am at The Bothy in Norbury Park; transport is provided to and from site and work tasks finish around 3.30pm. Volunteers need to wear suitable outdoor clothing and bring a packed lunch (tea, coffee and biscuits are provided). 


If you’re interested in volunteering, please call Anna Fosbery on 01483 795464 or email anna.fosbery@surreywt.org.uk, for more information.

Every Wednesday, throughout the year, SWT East area operates a conservation volunteer work party across its wildlife reserves, where participants carry out a range of practical tasks from scrub and small tree clearance to boardwalk installation, gate hanging and step building. 


SWT east area manager, Graham Manning, says: “Volunteering for the East Area Team of Surrey Wildlife Trust will make you part of our network of volunteering all over the county.  You’ll get free training and learn about our reserves and how your important work is benefitting the wildlife there, as well as the people who come to use and enjoy them.”


Tuition, tools and expert advice are given by SWT rangers and committed, long-term volunteers will be trained in brush cutter use and monitoring techniques, so they can expand their interests and be given specialist jobs to complete.


The volunteers meet at 9.15am at The Bothy in Norbury Park; transport is provided to and from site and work tasks finish around 3.30pm. Volunteers need to wear suitable outdoor clothing and bring a packed lunch (tea, coffee and biscuits are provided). 


If you’re interested in volunteering, please call Anna Fosbery on 01483 795464 or email anna.fosbery@surreywt.org.uk, for more information.

    22: <h5>
    23: <p>On the Sunday 12TH December, 30 local residents and volunteers of all ages came along to help improve the footpaths and woods of Westfield Common.  The day was jointly organized by Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT) Greenspace Project and Westfield Common Residents Association.   Thanks to a tidy up earlier in the autumn there was very little litter about, but the footpaths through the wood were becoming overgrown with holly and bramble. The aim of the day was to improve access to the wood by widening the footpaths and clearing glades of bramble and holly to let more light into the wood.  This will help to encourage more wildflowers to grow on the woodland floor.</p>

<h3><p>Volunteers have a jolly holly day!</p></h3>
<h5>
<p>On the Sunday 12TH December, 30 local residents and volunteers of all ages came along to help improve the footpaths and woods of Westfield Common.  The day was jointly organized by Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT) Greenspace Project and Westfield Common Residents Association.   Thanks to a tidy up earlier in the autumn there was very little litter about, but the footpaths through the wood were becoming overgrown with holly and bramble. The aim of the day was to improve access to the wood by widening the footpaths and clearing glades of bramble and holly to let more light into the wood.  This will help to encourage more wildflowers to grow on the woodland floor.</p>


<p>The event was held in the wood next to Bonners Close, tools were provided by SWT. After a safety talk by Frances Halstead from SWT the local residents donned gloves and armed with loppers and secateurs cleared the paths and glades.  </p>


<p>Crafty members among the volunteers had a go at making Christmas wreaths with the holly cut from the common and very professional they looked too!  The remaining holly and bramble was put in 20 bags and Woking Borough Council kindly arranged for their collection and recycling.</p>


<p>Frances Halstead Environmental Group Support Officer with SWT Greenspace Project said “It was great to see the community working together to improve their area.  The enthusiasm of the volunteers was fantastic!  Not dampened by the cold weather, it was only when the light began to fail that everyone packed up for the day.  For many of the volunteers it was their first experience of volunteering and the great sense of achievement they felt at the improved appearance of the wood was evident on their smiling faces.  What a rewarding day for everyone!”</p>


<p>We hope this will be the first of many similar practical days on the Common.  If you would like to know more about this project and Westfield Common or how to volunteer, please contact Frances Halstead on 01483 795478 or email frances.halstead@surreywt.org.uk.</p>

<p><h3>Beat the winter blues by volunteering outside</h3></p>
<h5>
<p>Blow away the Christmas cobwebs and beat the winter blues by volunteering in the great outdoors for Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT)!  </p>
<p>Every Wednesday, throughout the year, SWT East area operates a conservation volunteer work party across its wildlife reserves, where participants carry out a range of practical tasks from scrub and small tree clearance to boardwalk installation, gate hanging and step building. </p>


<p>SWT east area manager, Graham Manning, says: “Volunteering for the East Area Team of Surrey Wildlife Trust will make you part of our network of volunteering all over the county.  You’ll get free training and learn about our reserves and how your important work is benefitting the wildlife there, as well as the people who come to use and enjoy them.”</p>


<p>Tuition, tools and expert advice are given by SWT rangers and committed, long-term volunteers will be trained in brush cutter use and monitoring techniques, so they can expand their interests and be given specialist jobs to complete.</p>


<p>The volunteers meet at 9.15am at The Bothy in Norbury Park; transport is provided to and from site and work tasks finish around 3.30pm. Volunteers need to wear suitable outdoor clothing and bring a packed lunch (tea, coffee and biscuits are provided). </p>


<p>If you’re interested in volunteering, please call Anna Fosbery on 01483 795464 or email anna.fosbery@surreywt.org.uk, for more information.</p>

<h3><p>Thursley, Elstead, Ockley, Royal & Bagmoor Commons Public Consultation<p></h3>
<h5>
<p>Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT), in partnership with the Ministry of Defence/Defence Estates (MoD/DE) and Natural England (NE), is undertaking a major review of the management of Thursley, Ockley, Elstead, Royal and Bagmoor Commons, and has embarked on a consultation process to seek the views of members of the public, local communities, organisations, stakeholders and visitors to understand how they use, experience and value the Commons, in order to help decide how they should be managed for wildlife and people.<p>

<p>A number of drop-in days and events have taken place over the last two years, to discuss the issues with visitors, users and stakeholders. All of the feedback given at these events and drop in days and/or submitted separately, has been collated and analysed. <p>

<p>We are aware that notices have recently been placed at the main access points around the Commons, urging users and visitors to voice their concerns about the consultation to SWT. The Trust has recently posted their own notice at the main access points to rectify any misinformation and answer concerns. <p>

<p>A report detailing the responses on the future management of the Commons can also be downloaded below. <p>

<p>Please direct any enquiries to Zoe Grainger at Surrey Wildlife Trust, School Lane, Pirbright, Woking, Surrey GU24 0JN or e-mail Zoe.Grainger@surreywt.org.uk

The day was jointly organized by Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT) Greenspace Project and Westfield Common Residents Association. Thanks to a tidy up earlier in the autumn there was very little litter about, but the footpaths through the wood were becoming overgrown with holly and bramble. The aim of the day was to improve access to the wood by widening the footpaths and clearing glades of bramble and holly to let more light into the wood. This will help to encourage more wildflowers to grow on the woodland floor.\r\n\r\nThe event was held in the wood next to Bonners Close, tools were provided by SWT. After a safety talk by Frances Halstead from SWT the local residents donned gloves and armed with loppers and secateurs cleared the paths and glades.\r\n\r\nCrafty members among the volunteers had a go at making Christmas wreaths with the holly cut from the common and very professional they looked too! The remaining holly and bramble was put in 20 bags and Woking Borough Council kindly arranged for their collection and recycling.\r\n\r\nFrances Halstead Environmental Group Support Officer with SWT Greenspace Project said “It was great to see the community working together to improve their area. The enthusiasm of the volunteers was fantastic! Not dampened by the cold weather, it was only when the light began to fail that everyone packed up for the day. For many of the volunteers it was their first experience of volunteering and the great sense of achievement they felt at the improved appearance of the wood was evident on their smiling faces. What a rewarding day for everyone!”\r\n\r\nWe hope this will be the first of many similar practical days on the Common. If you would like to know more about this project and Westfield Common or how to volunteer, please contact Frances Halstead on 01483 795478 or email frances.halstead@surreywt.org.uk.\r\n", "news_pictures_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"news_picture"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x000000048d0a00 @original_filename="Kestrel.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"news_admin[news_pictures_attributes][0][news_picture]\"; filename=\"Kestrel.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n", @tempfile=#<File:/tmp/RackMultipart20120112-3529-pcl7u2>>}}}, "commit"=>"Create News admin"}

[["content", "On the Sunday 12TH December, 30 local residents and volunteers of all ages came along to help improve the footpaths and woods of Westfield Common. The day was jointly organized by Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT) Greenspace Project and Westfield Common Residents Association. Thanks to a tidy up earlier in the autumn there was very little litter about, but the footpaths through the wood were becoming overgrown with holly and bramble. The aim of the day was to improve access to the wood by widening the footpaths and clearing glades of bramble and holly to let more light into the wood. This will help to encourage more wildflowers to grow on the woodland floor.\r\n\r\nThe event was held in the wood next to Bonners Close, tools were provided by SWT. After a safety talk by Frances Halstead from SWT the local residents donned gloves and armed with loppers and secateurs cleared the paths and glades.\r\n\r\nCrafty members among the volunteers had a go at making Christmas wreaths with the holly cut from the common and very professional they looked too! The remaining holly and bramble was put in 20 bags and Woking Borough Council kindly arranged for their collection and recycling.\r\n\r\nFrances Halstead Environmental Group Support Officer with SWT Greenspace Project said “It was great to see the community working together to improve their area. The enthusiasm of the volunteers was fantastic! Not dampened by the cold weather, it was only when the light began to fail that everyone packed up for the day. For many of the volunteers it was their first experience of volunteering and the great sense of achievement they felt at the improved appearance of the wood was evident on their smiling faces. What a rewarding day for everyone!”\r\n\r\nWe hope this will be the first of many similar practical days on the Common. If you would like to know more about this project and Westfield Common or how to volunteer, please contact Frances Halstead on 01483 795478 or email frances.halstead@surreywt.org.uk.\r\n"], ["created_at", Thu, 12 Jan 2012 00:15:14 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Volunteers have a jolly holly day!"], ["updated_at", Thu, 12 Jan 2012 00:15:14 UTC +00:00]]

The day was jointly organized by Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT) Greenspace Project and Westfield Common Residents Association. Thanks to a tidy up earlier in the autumn there was very little litter about, but the footpaths through the wood were becoming overgrown with holly and bramble. The aim of the day was to improve access to the wood by widening the footpaths and clearing glades of bramble and holly to let more light into the wood. This will help to encourage more wildflowers to grow on the woodland floor.\r\n \r\n   The event was held in the wood next to Bonners Close, tools were provided by SWT. After a safety talk by Frances Halstead from SWT the local residents donned gloves and armed with loppers and secateurs cleared the paths and glades.\r\n\r\n   Crafty members among the volunteers had a go at making Christmas wreaths with the holly cut from the common and very professional they looked too! The remaining holly and bramble was put in 20 bags and Woking Borough Council kindly arranged for their collection and recycling.\r\n\r\n   Frances Halstead Environmental Group Support Officer with SWT Greenspace Project said “It was great to see the community working together to improve their area. The enthusiasm of the volunteers was fantastic! Not dampened by the cold weather, it was only when the light began to fail that everyone packed up for the day. For many of the volunteers it was their first experience of volunteering and the great sense of achievement they felt at the improved appearance of the wood was evident on their smiling faces. What a rewarding day for everyone!”\r\n\r\n   We hope this will be the first of many similar practical days on the Common.
